Assignment 5a/b - Design Patterns

**Plans for design Patterns:**

- Singlton: There should be one world.  I will make the world a singlton so that there cannot be multiple worlds at a time.  That world will have cyles, which will have wether, and the world will have trainers, a wilderness which has wild Code-a-mon, and a store.
- Factory: I will use a factory pattern to create Code-a-mons.  Since all code-a-mons are of the same family, they can be built using a factory, and they can     perform thier functions based on an interface.
- Mediator: The interactions during a battle would be complex if everything was allowed to communicate directly, so instead I will use a mediator pattern that will handle battles as the single point to reduce complexity in the battle senarios.
